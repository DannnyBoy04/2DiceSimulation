# Overview

This is a basic C program that rolls 2 dice the provided number of times and outputs the how many times every sum appeared, giving a normal distribution centered around 7 as each dice has an average roll value of 3,5.
The program requires arguments for how many times to roll the dice and can optionally be made to write its output to an output file instead of the default ``stdout`` (terminal).

## Example output

The required output of the program can be seen in the ``output.txt`` file.
